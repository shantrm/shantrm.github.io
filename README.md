**All pages:**

### 2. Add Your Resume

Place your resume PDF in the root directory and name it `resume.pdf`, or update the link in `index.html` to point to your resume file.

### 3. Add Photos to Gallery

1. Create a folder called `photos` in the root directory
2. Add your photos to this folder (recommended: photo1.jpg, photo2.jpg, etc.)
3. Update the image paths and captions in `personal.html`

### 4. Preview Locally
